GSE3431/ - folder with CEL files and SOFT files from NCBI GEO and author's website http://moment.utmb.edu/cgi-bin/dload.cgi

IDLists/
  - DIP_Prot_Names_in_LargestConnComp.tsv - DIP interactor names in largest connected component of graph. DIP interaction id's from DIP 2015-01-01 dataset. Used for Uniprot and other matching queries.
  - RepPubID.txt - There are 6757 Representative Public IDs to match against all probesets. We'll take these as our "genes".
  - TranscriptID.txt - all the probeset ids from Tu et.al.'s YG_S98 affy experiment
  - YG-S98_control - control probes from YG_S98 affy chip

old/
  contains files that are based on older analysis/code. They're here in case I need to refer them for something.
